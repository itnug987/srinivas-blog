> Why do we always think about the past and ruin our present? Why do we not live at the moment ? In this blog, I am going to talk about how our past is haunting and ruining our present moments.

## How to stop worrying about the past

We all have bad memories in our life. We also have good memories that we will cherish for life. Then why does bad part dominate the good. Just give it a thought. What do you think? Let me tell you what I think. It dominates because we let it to be. Yes, we constantly think that it's because that happenend I am like this now. It's because that day I could not do it, I can not do it now. We always blame others for our mistakes. Now, think what can you do to stop that? Let me suggest you a way. Journal everything that has happened to you that you think is a bad memory on a notebook. Let it out of your heart. Then think with a fresh mind, is it worth to worry about all those things. Is it worth to be losing your precious time by thinking about those?
If you do this, you will get the answer to your questions.

## How to start living the present

Time is precious. Once gone, cannot come back. I know it's too old for this saying but it's true. Before spending time on anything, think whether it can help you achieve you goals. Try thinking this way, if we can do all the things that we want to complete that day and fell asleep with full satisfaction, how will be the next day? The next day will be a beautiful day again and you will spend the whole day with full enthusiasm and will work harder to achieve your goals. At the end of the day, you are going to feel satisfied when you have worked hard to achieve your ultimate goal. It can be travelling the world, building a business etc. Even if you can contribute 0.1% to achieve your goals, you will feel satified and fulfilled.

> Don't let your PAST blackmail your PRESENT to ruin your beautiful FUTURE.

Live, Laugh and Experience Life. Cheers!!
